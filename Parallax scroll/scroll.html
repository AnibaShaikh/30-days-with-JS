      <article class="content"><h2>BEAUTY OF PAKISTAN</h2>
        <p>Pakistan is basically a gift of God and it is very rich in every sense whether its culture, food, agriculture, economic, minerals, history and also in beautiful places. Pakistan is a country which is totally covered with beauty and in every province of Pakistan there is something which is attractive and sight or view for tourist which tourist wants. Pakistan is the best place for every kind of tourist because in Pakistan there is a variety of beauty due to which tourist all around the world come here and enjoy the marvelous scene of beauty and appreciate the nature. In Pakistan there are many places where people like to go Gilgit, Murree, Swat, Kaghan and many more.</p>
        <p>The rich and gripping culture that is differnet in all the four provinces is famous around the world.Among these, the most influential was of Mughals.Their buildings with eccentric architectural style and exquiste decor is liked by every eye witnessing it.Whether it is Badshahi mosque or Shalimar Gardens none could ignore the delighting buildings ,murals,stonework with intricate designs and patterns .The fashinable yet, quaint sights hold immense beauty.</p>
        <p>The developed urban centers such as Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore are the epitome of civic life of the Pakistani nationals. The recent development has seen construction of soaring skyscrapers around these cities. Lahore has become a perfect combination of ancient and modern architecture and it also shows the transformation the city has witnessed in last four centuries. Likewise ‘Monal’ is a recently constructed on the plateau of Margalla hills and visitors are awe-struck by the night view of the city of Islamabad, the restaurant offers.</p>
        <p>Now is the time to come together and see what needs to be done to achieve this goal. A growth narrative for Pakistan needs to rest on these four elements: investing in people; using resources more efficiently; caring for the environment; and finally, improving how Pakistan is run to support growth and the implementation of difficult reforms.</p>
